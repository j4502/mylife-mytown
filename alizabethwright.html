<p>With her father in the military, Alizebeth Wright is the first to acknowledge that her childhood has been anything but typical.</p>

<p>Each time he's re-stationed she's been forced to move around the world, along with her mom, four sisters, and little brother. When deployment pulls her father away from home for long stretches of time it's difficult for Alizebeth to fully enjoy the added freedom this means for her–her mother is far more lenient than her father–without shutting out the nagging sense of worry for her dad that envelopes her mother when he is away.</p>
