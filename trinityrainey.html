<p><em>By: Grant Hindsley, Elizabeth Troval</em></p>

<p>Trinity Rainey finds it both funny and frustrating when people mistake her for a boy at work.</p>

<p>Her short hair and white T shirt complete her self-proclaimed "lesbian look." At 16, Trinity has learned not to spend too much time worrying about what others think, as a gay teen in Macon, Missouri.

A junior in high school, Trinity spends most of her time singing in choir, working two jobs, and playing varsity basketball. Though she hasn't decided what she wants to study, after high school Trinity looks forward to attending the University of Missouri. She already has her own Peace Nook bumper sticker on the back of her car.</p>
